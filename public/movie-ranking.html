<h1>ColinJ's Favorite Movies circa June 2023</h1>
<h2>My top 3 war movies:</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Blackhawk Down</h3>
<p>Excellent direction of a huge high-power cast. Perfect use of soundtrack to create mood and almost act as a supplemental narrator. Excellent and impactful action.</p>
<h3>Thin Red Line</h3>
<p>Fantastic direction of a large high-powered cast. Hauntingly beautiful imagery and composition. Magnificent cerebral trip through war and its horrors.</p>
<h3>Dunkirk</h3>
<p>Stunning composition that takes full advantage of the super wide film stock it was shot on. &#40;Also a rare achievement to shoot on film instead of employing digital filmmaking.&#41; Masterful control of nonlinear storytelling.</p>
<h2>My top 3 movies with devastating impact:</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Requiem for a Dream</h3>
<p>Brilliant acting, direction, composition, and storytelling. Adapted from a bleak and radical 1960s novel, the film retains the novel's '60s slang-drenched dialog. Ellen Burstyn's most masterful dramatic performance.</p>
<h3>Blindness</h3>
<p>Devastating pandemic contagion dystopia. Its horrors were more acute when it was released because it predates the Covid Pandemic by at least a decade. Masterfully directed, shot, and acted.</p>
<h3>Rabbit-Proof Fence</h3>
<p>Gorgeous film adaptation of one family's biographical journey through Australia's brutal anti-miscegenation law and practices towards Aborigines. A perfect marriage of gorgeous cinematography and haunting score with indigenous tribal overtones. A must see!</p>
